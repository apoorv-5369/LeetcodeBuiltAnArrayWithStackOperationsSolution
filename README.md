# LeetcodeBuiltAnArrayWithStackOperationsSolution
You are given an array target and an integer n.

In each iteration, you will read a number from list = [1, 2, 3, ..., n].

Build the target array using the following operations:

"Push": Reads a new element from the beginning list, and pushes it in the array.

"Pop": Deletes the last element of the array.

If the target array is already built, stop reading more elements.
Return a list of the operations needed to build target. The test cases are generated so that the answer is unique.
